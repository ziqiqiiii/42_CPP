# -- [Polymorphism] --
meaning "having many forms," represents the ability of an entity to adapt and behave differently in different contexts.

1. Function Overloading: In C++, multiple functions can have the same name but different parameter types, allowing the same function call to behave differently depending on the arguments provided.
2. Virtual Functions: In C++, declaring a function virtual allows derived classes to provide their own implementation, enabling polymorphism through pointers or references to base class objects.
3. Interfaces: Define a set of behaviors without implementation, forcing derived classes to implement them, ensuring compatibility and polymorphism in different objects.
