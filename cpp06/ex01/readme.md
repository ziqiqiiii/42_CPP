# Reinterpret Cast (reinterpret_cast)

- Provides a low-level cast that allows you to convert any pointer type to any other pointer type or any integral type to any pointer type.
- It is very powerful and can be dangerous if used incorrectly, as it bypasses type safety checks.

```cpp
int* intptr;
char* charptr = reinterpret_cast<char*>(intptr); // Convert int* to char*

```
