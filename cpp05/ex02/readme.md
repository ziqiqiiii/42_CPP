# srand() and rand()

Imagine you have a magical seed bag (rand() function) that can produce an endless variety of plants (random numbers). However, before you start planting, you need to decide what type of garden you want to grow. The type of garden is determined by the initial seed you use.

## srand() - Seeding the Garden:

srand() is like choosing the initial seed for your garden. Just like how different seeds grow different types of plants, different seed values will produce different sequences of random numbers.
For example, if you use the seed "12345" to plant your garden, you'll get a specific sequence of plants. But if you use the seed "98765", you'll get a completely different sequence of plants.
You can choose any seed you like, such as the current time, your age, or the number of letters in your name.

## rand() - Growing Plants:

Once you've seeded your garden with srand(), you can start planting seeds (rand() function) and growing plants (random numbers).
Each time you plant a seed (rand()), you'll get a different plant (random number) from your garden.
The type of plant you get depends on the seed you used to start your garden (srand()), but it's still a bit random because you can't predict exactly which plant will grow next.
In summary, srand() sets the initial conditions for your garden (random number generator), and rand() lets you grow an endless variety of plants (random numbers) based on those initial conditions. By choosing different seeds with srand(), you can grow different sequences of random numbers with rand().
