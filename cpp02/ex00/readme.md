### Copy Constructor:

Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
##### Use it when:
Initializing a new object with an existing object:
MyClass obj2(obj1);
MyClass obj3 = obj1; (copy initialization)
Passing an object by value to a function.
Returning an object by value from a function.
Storing objects in containers like vectors or lists.
###Copy Assignment Operator:

Assigns the value of one existing object to another existing object.
##### Use it when:
Assigning one object to another using the = operator:
obj2 = obj1;
### Key Considerations:

### Default implementations: The compiler provides default versions, but you might need to define your own for custom behavior (e.g., deep copying, resource management).
Rule of Three/Five/Zero: Consider defining all three (destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator) or none for consistency and exception safety.
Move semantics (C++11 and later): Often more efficient for resource transfer than copying.
Exception handling: Ensure proper resource cleanup in constructors and assignment operators if copying fails.
### In summary:

Use the copy constructor to create new objects as copies of existing ones.
Use the copy assignment operator to modify existing objects with values from other objects.
Carefully consider resource management and exception safety when defining these operators.
