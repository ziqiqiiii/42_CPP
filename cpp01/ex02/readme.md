## Pointer and Reference
1. Memory Management:

Pointer (stringPTR): Holds the memory address of the variable (strVar). It doesn't create another copy of the data, but rather points to the existing location.
Reference (stringREF): Acts as an alias for the original variable (strVar). It doesn't store an address, but directly refers to the same memory location as strVar.
2. Declaration:

Pointer: Requires using the * operator before the variable name during declaration (std::string *stringPTR).
Reference: Uses the & operator after the variable name during declaration (std::string &stringREF).
3. Reassignment:

Pointer: Can be reassigned to point to different memory locations (stringPTR = nullptr;).
Reference: Cannot be reassigned after initialization, as it's permanently bound to the original variable (stringREF = someOtherString; // Invalid).
4. Null value:

Pointer: Can be assigned a nullptr value, indicating it doesn't point to any valid memory location.
Reference: Cannot be assigned a null value, as it must always refer to an existing variable.
Output Analysis:

The code outputs the memory addresses and values to showcase the differences:

Memory addresses:
&strVar, stringPTR, and &stringREF all print the same address, as they all refer to the memory location of the strVar variable.
Values:
strVar, *stringPTR, and stringREF all print the same value, "HI THIS IS BRAIN", as they access the same data.
In summary, while both pointers and references provide ways to access data indirectly, they differ in:

Memory Management: Pointers store addresses, while references directly refer to the same location.
Declaration Syntax: Pointers use * before the name, while references use & after.
Reassignment: Pointers can be reassigned, while references cannot.
Null Value: Pointers can be null, while references cannot.
Pointers offer more flexibility but require careful management to avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers. References are safer and easier to use but lack the flexibility of pointers for specific memory manipulations.
